# AcmeBankApp

## Overview
This is a group project for the development of a C# application for Acme Bank. The application is designed to cater to tellers who need to access customer accounts. It involves the handling of three types of accounts: Personal, ISA, and Business.

## Project Scope: The Banking App
### Scenario
Acme Bank has enlisted our team to create a C# application facilitating tellers in accessing customer accounts. Here are the key points regarding each type of account:

### Personal Account:
- Customers opening a personal account must provide both a photo ID (passport, driving license) and an address-based ID (utility bill, council letter).
- The minimum opening balance for a personal account is £1 (GBP).
- No charges apply for owning the account, but overdrafts may incur charges.
- The account supports services like direct debits and standing orders for bill payments.

### ISA Account:
- Rules for the ISA account can be found at [Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs): Overview - GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/individual-savings-accounts).
- Customers with ISA accounts benefit from an annual APR of 2.75% on the average annual balance.
- Each customer is limited to one ISA account.

### Business Account:
- Business account eligibility requires proof and details of an existing business.
- Certain business types (enterprise, plc, charity, public sector) will be handled by a separate department.
- A business account comes with a business cheque book (upon request) and incurs an annual charge of £120 (GBP).
- Account holders receive debit/credit cards and may access an overdraft facility, international trading, and loans.

## General Rules:
- A single customer can have each of the three account types, adhering to specific rules within each account.
- Customers do not have direct access to the software; authentication methods must be implemented.
- The software should gracefully handle unexpected data entries and remain functional.
- A graphical user interface (GUI) is not mandatory; ensure the core functionality works before GUI implementation.
- A simple menu system is required with validated information submission.
- A help system linked to user actions should support the user.
- Document any assumptions made in a separate document.
- Upload the completed work to a group agreed Git repository.
- Questions during the requirements gathering phase are encouraged.

## Questions to ASK:
- Do we need to create customer accounts?
- Do we a need a personal account to open an ISA or Busisness?
- Do we need to consider transactions?
- Do we need to consider loans and business cheques? If so how would we manage cheques?
- There are 4 types of ISA accounts in the GOV website. Are we expected to implement all of them?
- There are inflexible and flexible ISA accounts. Are we expecte to account for them?

## Assumptions:
- Assume that the user knows their card information
- Trevor has VIsual Paradigm installed on his PC

        3. Payment
        4. Transfer
        5. Manage Standing Orders/Direct Debits

### Deposit
The teller inputs a value which gets deposited into the account. It checks to see if the amount value inputted is valid. If so, the money gets added to the account.

### Withdraw
The teller inputs a value which gets withdrawn from the account. The value is checked to see if the transaction can be achieved. For different account types, it is different. For the personal and business accounts, it checks to see if the amount withdrawn will exceed the overdraft limit. For the ISA account, it updates the deposit limit attached to the account.

### Payment
It first checks to see if the customer can pay another account. Then it tells the teller inputs an account number to which the customer wants to put it into, excluding the account which is doing the payment and excluding ISA accounts. Once a calid account number is inputted, the teller is then prompted to put an amount to pay to the inputted account. Once the value inputted has been validated, the money is withdrawn from the customer account and deposited to the payee account.

### Transfer
Prompts the teller to select from a range of accounts to transfer money to. The customer directs them to the account they want money transferred to. The accounts listed will be the other accounts said customer has. Once selected, the teller then inputs a value which deposits the money to the stated account.

### Manage Standing Order / Direct debits
This is a method exclusive to a personal account type.

### Statement
Method which displays the statement of the account to the teller

### Request Credit/Debit Card
A method to say that a card would be delivered to the account address. A personal account can only request for a debit card but a business account can request for both credit and debit

### Manage Overdraft
The teller is told to direct the customer to the business overdraft division.

### Exit
Selecting this option exits out of the account options loop and go back to the view customer accounts option.
